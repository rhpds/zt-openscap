== Remediating and rescanning against a profile

One of the many failed rules in the scan previously done was related to
IPSec support. In this step, you will remediate a single failed rule
related to IPSec support.

____
[!NOTE] Many of the remediations involve restarting the host, and the
current demo environment does not support host reboots yet. Thus, this
lab will focus only on remediating a single issue.
____

Re-scan the host passing the _â€“remediation_ option to carry out an
online remediation. Additionally, provide the Rule ID from the previous
step (_xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed_)
to remediate the specific rule. If no Rule ID is provided, oscap
attempts to remediate all the failed rules.

[source,bash,run]
----
oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss --remediate --fetch-remote-resources --results scan-xccdf-results.xml --rule xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
----

To verify that the issue is remediated, re-run the previous command.
Oscap only attempts to fix what is broken, so it will not remediate an
already fixed rule.

[source,bash,run]
----
oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss --remediate --fetch-remote-resources --results scan-xccdf-results.xml --rule xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
----

The remediation starts but there is no work left to be done.
